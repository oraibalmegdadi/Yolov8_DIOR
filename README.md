# Applying Yolov8 Object Detection Model to DIOR Dataset
DIOR is a large-scale benchmark dataset for optical remote sensing image target detection proposed on the research paper "**Object detection in optical remote sensing images: A survey and a new benchmark**" [1] . The dataset contains around 20Kimages, with an image size of 800Ã—800 pixels and covers 20 object classes.
These 20 object classes are: Wind mill, Vehicle, Train station, Tennis court, Storage Tank, Ship, Harbor, Stadium, Ground Track Field, Golf course, Expressway toll station, Expressway service area, Dam, Chimney, Bridge, Overpass, Basketball Court, Baseball field, Airport, Airplane.
